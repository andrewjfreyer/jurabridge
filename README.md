## Description

This is an ESP32 Arduino project for bridging a [Jura Ena Micro 90](https://us.jura.com/en/customer-care/products-support/ENA-Micro-90-MicroSilver-UL-15116) to home automation platforms via MQTT. Main controller is an ESP32. A 3v to 5v level shifter is required between an available UART of the ESP32 to the debug/service port of the Jura.

Optionally, a two channel relay board can be used to simulate the dual throw momentary switches that power on the input board and the power control boards, respectively. I control this with a second ESP32, but the same ESP could be used too. 

The data output from the machine can be received and presented by [Home Assistant.](https://www.home-assistant.io) I have created this status UI in a heavily modified [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card). 

### Example UI: Bridge Off

## Custom Preparations & Actions

Once accurate machine status information is pulled from the machine, any number of custom recipes or custom instruction sequences can be excuted, without needing to modify EEPROM or to orchestrate a valid sequence of `FN:` commands. This ensures that the machine excutes its own in-built sequences, and there's no risk of incidentally damaging the machine with custom instructions or custom brew sequences. 

Any number of different sequence customizations can be made to allow the machine to produce a wide variety of other drinks. As a trivial example, different settings may be appropriate for non-dairy cappuccino than dairy cappuccino, yet the machine only has one setting. 

#### Double Ristretto Custom Recipe

Here is a brew sequence I use for stronger, more traditionally extracted espresso. It  pulls two ristretto shots back to back, each at roughly 30ml. This results in a much more flavorful and properly extracted whole shot. A technique like this is viable and does not waste coffee, as each Jura grind operation only uses 7g of coffee, compared against the ~15g of a traditional espresso pull.

## Connection Diagram 

*Diagram to come...*

## Software

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). Note that you may have to install serial drivers. 

* Board: ESP32 Dev Module

## Setup 

Open sketch in Arduino IDE, modify the `secrets.h` file, verify, and upload. Sketch defaults to UART 2, which on this board is Pin 16, 17. These pins couple to the Jura debug port.
