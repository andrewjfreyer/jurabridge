# TL;DR

ESP32 Arduino project for bridging a [Jura ENA Micro 90](https://us.jura.com/en/customer-care/products-support/ENA-Micro-90-MicroSilver-UL-15116) to home automation platforms via MQTT. A 3.3v to 5v level shifter is required between hardware UART of the ESP32 to the service port of the Jura. The ESP32 polls the Jura for status information via reverse-engineered Jura Service Port calls, calculates/determines device state and meta statuses and reports changes to an MQTT broker. 

See here for [hardware](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Hardware) and [software](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/software) requirements. [Connections are straightforward.](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Hardware#connection-diagram)

# Why? Why do you do this? It's a discontinued machine...

For fun, that's all. I saw [this](https://github.com/ryanalden/esphome-jura-component/) and other projects and thought I'd begin investigating whether some or all of the functionality would extend to the Jura ENA Micro 90. Many did, many did not. Turns out, I needed to investigate and characterize a lot of the output from the machine. One thing led to another, and now we're here.

# Home Assistant

Here's my Home Assistant [configuration (YAML package)](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Home-Assistant-Configuration-v2). Here is what the bridge looks like, attached to the machine after a few destructive [modifications](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Jura-Ena-Micro-90-Modifications) to feed a ribbon cable through the housing to the debug port.

# Custom Preparations & Actions

I've found out that the default programming dramatically undersells the machine's capabilities. The Jura produces good enough shots as is. All that to say, since I bought the machine, my expectation was set that "this is the best it can do, and that's just fine." It is, after all, a superauto and sacrifies are made over a manual process. We're sacrificing some quality for pushbutton convenience. However, surprising to me was that the ENA Micro 90 only uses ***7-10g of coffee per perparation*** - with 30 some-odd ml of water. That's less coffee and more water than I presumed, without giving it much thought. Plus, pump pressure dropps pretty dramatically due to channeling so, the first parts of our shots are the best parts anyway. 

It's of course easy to pull two short shots back to back to get to a more traditional 15 - 20g "single" shot, but why not automate it? 
Lets just automate it. 

Here, because `jurabridge` obtains (and/or infers) accurate machine status information, any number of custom recipes or custom instruction sequences can be excuted, without needing to modify EEPROM or to orchestrate a valid sequence of `FN:` commands, or without waiting for unnecessary long delays to presuming machine state. This command+interrupt+statuswait technique ensures that the machine excutes its own in-built sequences, and there's no risk of incidentally damaging the brewgroup with custom instructions or custom brew sequences.

I have described some actions that involve modifying a Jura ENA Micro 90, which if performed will absolutely void any warranty you may have (which you probably don't; this machine is old). Some of the modifications described below involve mains electricity; all appropriate cautions are expected to be, and were, followed.
