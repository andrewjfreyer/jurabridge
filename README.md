## Description

This is an arduino project for bridging a Jura Ena Micro 90 to home automation platforms via MQTT. Main controller is an ESP32. A 3v to 5v level shifter is required between an available UART of the ESP32 to the debug/service port of the Jura. 

Optionally, a second ESP32 or other controller can be used to simulate the dual throw momentary switches that power on the input board and the power control boards, respectively. 

## Hardware

* ESP32 Dev Board. I used [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0718T232Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* Level Shifter. I used [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LG646VS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* Dupont connectors. I used [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EV70C78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DF9BJKH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 

* (Optional) 2 Channel Relay Board. I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E0NTPP4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Relays are required if you'd like to turn the machine on. 

## Machine Modifications

* Plumb reservoir. I [used this.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076HJZQMY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* Create aperture through input board coverpiece to feed cable to ESP32. 

* 3d printed bridge housing

* Splice into momentary swich leads, close splices with 2-channel relay.

## Connection Diagram 

*Diagram to come...*

## Software

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). Note that you may have to install serial drivers. 

* Board: ESP32 Dev Module

## Setup 

Open sketch in Arduino IDE, modify the `secrets.h` file, verify, and upload. Sketch defaults to UART 2, which on this board is Pin 16, 17. These pins couple to the Jura debug port.
