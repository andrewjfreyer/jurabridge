> ### **[Summer 2023]** *This project is in an active research and development phase. The current codebase is a procedural proof of concept that is not designed (at all) with proper C++ class structure. Refactoring is underway, but it'll take time. Please be patient.*

# Description

This is an ESP32 Arduino project for bridging a [Jura ENA Micro 90](https://us.jura.com/en/customer-care/products-support/ENA-Micro-90-MicroSilver-UL-15116) to home automation platforms via MQTT. Main controller is an ESP32. A 3.3v to 5v level shifter is required between an available hardware UART of the ESP32 to the debug/service port of the Jura. Don't use `softwareserial`, as it's painfully slow. The ESP continually polls the Jura for status information, and reports changes in status information via MQTT. 

See here for [hardware](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Hardware) and [software](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/software) requirements. [Connections are straightforward.](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Hardware#connection-diagram)

# Why?

I saw [this](https://github.com/ryanalden/esphome-jura-component/) and other similar projects and thought I'd begin investigating whether some or all of the functionality would extend to the Jura ENA Micro 90. Many did, many did not. I needed to investigate and characterize a lot of the output from the machine. One thing led to another, and now we're here.

# Home Assistant

Here's my Home Assistant [configuration (YAML package)](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Home-Assistant-Configuration). Here is what the bridge looks like, attached to the machine after a few destructive [modifications](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/jurabridge/wiki/Jura-Ena-Micro-90-Modifications) to feed a ribbon cable to the debug port.

Here's a quick video demo showing the responsiveness of the polling:

The data output from the machine is received and presented by [Home Assistant.](https://www.home-assistant.io) I have created this status UI based on a modified fork of [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card).

*Note: Although loosely compatible, this code is far too large to work with ESPHome; attempts to get it to work usefully with all sensors updating at reasonable intervals caused watchdog crashes.*

# Custom Preparations & Actions

I've found out that the default programming of the machine undersells/underutilizes machine's capabilities. The Jura produces good enough shots as is. I never thought to question the dosing volume, as the output was good enough for what I expected from a superautomatic. 

All that to say, since I bought the machine, my expectation was set that "this is the best the Jura can do, and that's just fine." It is, after all, a superauto. We're sacrificing some quality for pushbutton convenience. However, somewhat surprising to me was that the ENA Micro 90 only uses ***7-10g of coffee per perparation*** - about half as much as I presumed. 

It's of course easy to pull two shots back to back to get to a more traditional 15 - 20g per pull. But that requires that I sit and wait, read words on a display, clear any errors, and press buttons twice. Who has time for that?

Lets just automate it. 

Here, because `jurabridge` obtains (and/or infers) accurate machine status information, any number of custom recipes or custom instruction sequences can be excuted, without needing to modify EEPROM or to orchestrate a valid sequence of `FN:` commands, or without waiting for unnecessary long delays and presuming machine state. This command+interrupt+statuswait technique ensures that the machine excutes its own in-built sequences, and there's no risk of incidentally damaging the brewgroup with custom instructions or custom brew sequences. 

Custom sequences/scripts can be made to allow the machine to produce a wide variety of other drinks, at higher quality. As a trivial example, different settings may be appropriate for non-dairy cappuccino than dairy cappuccino, yet the machine only has one setting.
